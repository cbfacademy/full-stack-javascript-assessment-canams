## About The Project

<p> CHI.skin is more than just another skincare app. The goal isn't just to help you get better (whatever your definition of the word is) skin - it's here to help you. Period. We're not here to sell you some brand new shiny product you'll forget about in a few weeks, we're here for the journey. You'll find many other apps out there that provide you a customised routine, but we know your priorities, circumstances and your skin itself is constantly changing; so we're building a routine, and an application that grows with you<sup>1</sup>. So, how about we learn to take care of our skin and achieve the results we want for real this time?</p>

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Features

Below are some of the key features of the application, and their purpose.
- [x] Initial quiz - a set of questions aimed at getting to know you more to create a more personalised routine. Questions about your skin help direct the focus of your routine (choose products with ingredients that address those concerns). Understanding your lifestyle suggests more involved routines if you have the time, or sticks to the basics if you're a busy bee (or just don't enjoy skincare). Your personalised plan is also adjusted to your budget - if you want to keep things striped back that's fine, and we have something for those willing to splurge.
- [x] Routine - a view of your weekly routine and any regular treatments to schedule if applicable. There is a focus for each day, so make sure to use products that address those concerns (check out the Learning section if you're not sure what to use!)
- [x] Today - a view of the steps you need to take today, morning routine and evening routine.
- [ ] Progress - upload and view past pictures of your skin and see how you're progressing. See a map of your consistency (how many days you completed your routine, any steps you haven't done in a while etc.) Regular check ins will appear on this page - a few questions on how you are progressing to adjust your routine if necessary.
- [x] Profile - a look at your current situation: your current skin type, concerns, lifestyle and budget preferences. If or when these change, you can retake the quiz to better reflect your current priorities.
- [x] Learning - the purpose of this section is to equip you with the knowledge to take charge of your own skin journey and understand not just what to do but why, encouraging a more intentional skincare journey.
