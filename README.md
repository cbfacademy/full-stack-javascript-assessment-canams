## Introduction

For your assessment, you are to create a full-stack web application of your choosing. You could build:

1. Search Engine
1. Chat Application
1. Sentiment Analysis
1. Product Recommendation Engine

or whatever you'd like.

This assessment offers you the choice to embrace either a monolithic (all in one) or a mono-repo (in separate pieces) architecture for your full-stack application. While the realm of microservices is gaining traction, understanding both monolithic and mono-repo setups provides a well-rounded perspective.

Opting for a monolithic architecture simplifies deployment, eases developmental complexities, and ensures a comprehensive view of the application stack. On the other hand, choosing the mono-repo route gives you a taste of modular organisation, scalable structures, and the ability to deploy parts independently while maintaining a centralised codebase. Whichever path you choose, this project ensures you garner deep insights and hands-on experience.

By default, this codebase has been set up as a mono-repo; to deploy as a monolith, you will need to make a few adjustments. [You can find out how to make the changes in this short guide](docs/deployment.md).

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this assessment, you will have demonstrated your ability to:

1. **Design and Architect Applications**: Understand the nuances of designing a user-centric application, from your user's journey to how they interact with your database.
1. **Implement Best Practices**: Showcase your proficiency in following coding standards and structuring a project optimally.
1. **Utilise Full-Stack Development**: Master using React for your frontend, Node.js for your backend logic, and MongoDB for your data needs.
1. **Implement CI/CD**: Get hands-on with setting up and managing a CI/CD pipeline, leveraging tools like GitHub Actions.
1. **Deploy Applications**: Understand the process to get your applications up and running on platforms suitable for full-stack apps.
1. **Iterative Development & Feedback**: Appreciate the value of feedback loops in your software development journey and make iterations based on real user feedback.

By completing this assessment, you're set for a holistic dive into full-stack development using the JavaScript ecosystem and the intricacies of deploying and maintaining web applications.

## Requirements

- **Frontend**: Utilise React for creating user interfaces
- **Backend**: Build an API using Node.js and Express.js
- **Database**: Utilise MongoDB for data storage

### What we expect you to accomplish

- A fully deployed application with the URL to it in this README
- Comprehensive documentation

We have provided you with some ideas to help you achieve these, [which you can find here](#things-to-consider-whilst-building-your-application).

## Getting started

We have created this codebase as a skeleton for you to use. You can adapt it to your needs.

To get started with setting up this codebase on your machine [follow this guide we have created for you](docs/getting-started.md).

## Things to consider whilst building your application

### Design

- **User Flow**: Outline the user journey, considering main actions and navigation

- **UI/UX**: Sketch a simple UI using tools like Figma or Adobe XD. Ensure a thoughtful user experience and consider tools like Google Lighthouse for insights on performance and accessibility

For more tips refer to the [Design guide](docs/design-guide.md).

### Code Quality & Structure

- **Best Practices**: Adhere to coding best practices such as naming conventions, DRY principles, and more

- **Design Patterns**: Consider popular patterns, like MVC, to structure your web application

For more tips refer to the [Code Quality & Structure guide](docs/code-quality-standards.md).

### Deployment

- **Platform**: Deploy on a platform like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [DigitalOcean App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/), or [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/).

- **Domain**: If you'd like, purchase a domain name from providers like [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) or [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/) and link it to your deployed application. If using AWS, you can manage domain names with [AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/).

For more tips refer to the [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment.md).

### Feedback

- **User Feedback**: Design a system to capture user feedback, whether it's through user interviews, surveys, or another medium

- **Iterative Development**: Use feedback to make improvements to your application, refining it based on real user needs

For more tips refer to the [Feedback Implementation Guide](docs/feedback-guide.md).

## Deliverables / What You Should Submit

1. The link to your GitHub repository

1. A deployed version of your application

1. Comprehensive documentation detailing your thought process, design choices, and more

Good luck with your assessment! You've got this 💪
